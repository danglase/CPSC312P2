== Course Schedule Bot ==
====Authors: Reed Esler, Dan Glaser ====

=== What is the problem? ===

Determining what courses you can take within a semester, and worrying about whether or not they overlap can cause many problems. With this project, we are hoping to resolve this problem by providing users with a list of courses available to a student that do not cause schedule conflicts and meet the users requirements.

=== What is the something extra? ===
If time is available, we will hopefully be able to create additional features such as a long term plan to provide users with quickest ways to meet degree requirements, and a full course load with specific professors.

===What did we learn from doing this?===
(This should be written after you have done the work.) What is the bottom-line? Is functional programming suitable for (part-of) the task? Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
